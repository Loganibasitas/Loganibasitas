### Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 8, Part 2

Lab 8, Part 2, is my third favorite lab among those I worked on with my partners because I gained a better understanding of what a for loop does with constant variables, such as const int kCounterMax = 22;. It was also satisfying to see the program's correct output after many failed tests until I finally had a breakthrough. I was excited to acknowledge that we're tasked to create a pattern through the shell command terminal.

* Lab 5, Part 1

Lab 5, Part 1, is my second favorite lab among those I worked on with my partners because it helped me understand what a function is in C++. It involved using multiple formulas within each function to calculate the area of a rectangle based on a couple of inputs and linking each file through the header. I initially had trouble understanding the return keyword but quickly grasped its purpose in the functions' .cpp file. I also liked this lab because it also had to deal with math which was only basic arithmetic in this assignment.

* Lab 12, Part 1

Lab 12, Part 1, is my favorite lab among those I worked on with my partners because it was the first time I was introduced to generating images through code during my programming journey. It combines functions, multiple header libraries, loops, and argument vectors, making it both complex and enjoyable, which is why I appreciated the final lab of the semester. It was challenging to figure out what went wrong in my final edit, as I didn't realize that the red and green were supposed to swap rows and columns which left me confused as to why red and green were about 94% incorrect when comparing the test results to both sample output and test output images.
